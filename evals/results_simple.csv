What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?,Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them as context to generate more accurate and grounded responses.,"**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation. It enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant context from external knowledge sources.

This approach addresses key LLM limitations—specifically **outdated information** and **hallucinations**—by grounding responses in retrieved factual data.

A typical RAG system consists of three main components:
1.  **Retrieval System:** Searches for relevant documents.
2.  **Embedding Model:** Converts text into vector representations.
3.  **Generation Model:** Produces responses based on the retrieved context.

**Analogy:**
To visualize this architecture, consider the **retrieval system** as a **""Librarian""** searching a **""Digital Library""** (Vector DB), the **embedding model** as a **""Translator""** converting the books into a searchable code, and the **generation model** as the **""Author""** writing the final story using only the sources found.",1,5,5,5,"The generated answer accurately defines RAG as combining information retrieval with text generation, matching the core definition of the expected answer. It is highly relevant to the user's question. It is fully grounded in the retrieved context, reflecting the explanation of how RAG addresses LLM limitations (outdated info, hallucinations) and listing the three main components."
What is the purpose of chunking in RAG systems?,"Chunking breaks down large documents into smaller, manageable pieces that can be efficiently embedded and retrieved. This allows the system to retrieve only the most relevant portions of documents rather than entire documents.","Based on the provided context, the purpose of chunking in RAG systems is to **break down large documents into smaller, manageable pieces** for AI retrieval.

This process is critical because it determines how effectively relevant information is fetched for accurate AI responses. Poor chunking strategies lead to **irrelevant results**, **inefficiency**, and **reduced business value**.

To ensure success, the chunking strategy (whether page-level, section-level, or token-based) must be optimized based on the specific document type and query patterns.",2,5,5,5,"The generated answer accurately matches the expected answer by stating that chunking breaks down large documents into smaller pieces for retrieval. It is highly relevant to the question, providing a comprehensive explanation of the purpose and its importance. It is fully faithful to the retrieved context, using specific details such as ""page-level, section-level, or token-based"" strategies and consequences like ""inefficiency"" that are explicitly present in the source text."
What are embeddings in the context of RAG?,"Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. In RAG systems, both document chunks and queries are converted to embeddings, which enables semantic similarity search for retrieving relevant context.","Embeddings are numerical representations of text chunks, allowing the system to process information mathematically. As stated in the context, documents are split into chunks and converted into embeddings using models like OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`. These vectors are then stored in a vector database.

**Analogy:**
Think of an embedding as a **""Digital Barcode""** for text. Just as a barcode allows a scanner to instantly identify a product in a store, an embedding allows the RAG system to quickly find the most relevant text chunks based on mathematical similarity.",1,4,5,5,"The generated answer correctly identifies embeddings as numerical representations and accurately describes their role in the RAG pipeline (splitting, conversion, storage). While it misses the specific expected details about ""semantic meaning"" and the use of embeddings for *queries*, it remains highly accurate. It is fully relevant to the question and faithfully reproduces the information from the retrieved context without introducing hallucinations."
What is a vector database and why is it used in RAG?,"A vector database stores embeddings and enables fast similarity search. In RAG systems, vector databases like Qdrant or Pinecone store document embeddings and allow efficient retrieval of the most similar chunks to a query.","A **vector database** is a specialized database designed to store and manage vector embeddings.

As described in the context, it is an essential component of RAG systems. It stores document embeddings and enables **efficient similarity search**. When a user asks a question, the system converts the query into a vector and retrieves the most similar document chunks from the database.

**Analogy:**
Think of a vector database like a **""Semantic Library""**. Unlike a traditional library that organizes books by alphabetical order or subject tags (keywords), a vector database organizes information by **meaning**. When you search for a concept, the database understands the intent and retrieves the books (document chunks) that are conceptually similar, even if they don't share specific keywords.",1,5,5,5,"The generated answer perfectly matches the expected answer in terms of content, defining a vector database as storing embeddings for similarity search and explaining its role in RAG for retrieving relevant chunks. It is highly relevant to the question. Regarding faithfulness, all the factual statements about the database's function in RAG are directly supported by the retrieved context. The analogy provided is a reasonable elaboration of the semantic search concept described in the text and does not contradict or hallucinate information."
What is LlamaIndex and what problem does it solve?,"LlamaIndex is a framework for building RAG applications. It provides tools for document ingestion, chunking, embedding, indexing, and querying, making it easier to connect LLMs with external data sources.","**LlamaIndex** is a framework and guide for building **data-backed LLM applications**. It serves as the core technique for implementing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, enabling LLMs to utilize private data at query time rather than relying solely on their pre-training.

By providing tools to construct **Agents, Workflows, and Query Engines**, LlamaIndex solves the problem of integrating external data into AI systems, allowing them to answer questions based on specific documents or knowledge bases.",3,5,5,5,"The generated answer accurately reflects the expected answer's core definition of LlamaIndex as a framework for RAG and data-backed LLM applications. It correctly identifies the problem it solves (integrating external data) and expands on the components mentioned in the context (Agents, Workflows, Query Engines). It is fully grounded in the retrieved context, which discusses these exact concepts and their role in LlamaIndex."
