What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?,Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. It retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them as context to generate more accurate and grounded responses.,"Based on the context provided in **`sample_rag_overview.pdf`** (Page 1), **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is defined as follows:

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI framework that combines **information retrieval** with **text generation**. It enhances large language models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant context from external knowledge sources.

This approach is designed to address common limitations of LLMs, such as outdated information and **hallucinations**, by grounding responses in retrieved factual data.

A typical RAG system consists of three main components:
1.  **A Retrieval System:** Searches for relevant documents.
2.  **An Embedding Model:** Converts text into vector representations.
3.  **A Generation Model:** Produces responses based on the retrieved context.",1,5,5,5,"The generated answer perfectly matches the expected definition of RAG by accurately stating it combines information retrieval with text generation. It is highly relevant as it directly answers the question and provides valuable context about components and benefits. It is fully faithful to the retrieved context, as every claim (definition, mention of LLMs, hallucinations, and the three components) is directly supported by the source text without any hallucinations or external fabrication."
What is the purpose of chunking in RAG systems?,"Chunking breaks down large documents into smaller, manageable pieces that can be efficiently embedded and retrieved. This allows the system to retrieve only the most relevant portions of documents rather than entire documents.","According to the **NVIDIA Technical Blog**, the purpose of chunking in RAG systems is defined in three key ways:

1.  **Preprocessing:** It is a critical step that involves splitting large documents into smaller, manageable pieces.
2.  **Efficiency:** These pieces allow for documents to be efficiently indexed, retrieved, and used as context during response generation.
3.  **Accuracy:** It determines how effectively relevant information is fetched for accurate AI responses. A smart chunking strategy improves retrieval precision and contextual coherence, which directly enhances the quality of the generated answers.",1,5,5,5,"The generated answer accurately reflects the expected answer and the retrieved context. It correctly identifies the core purpose of chunking as splitting documents into smaller pieces to facilitate efficient retrieval and improve accuracy, using specific terminology (e.g., ""preprocessing,"" ""retrieval precision"") found in the provided text. It is fully grounded in the context and directly addresses the user's question."
What are embeddings in the context of RAG?,"Embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. In RAG systems, both document chunks and queries are converted to embeddings, which enables semantic similarity search for retrieving relevant context.","According to the **RAG Overview** document (Page 3), **embeddings** are numerical representations of text.

In the context of RAG implementation:
1.  **Conversion:** Documents are split into chunks, and these chunks are converted into embeddings using models (such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small).
2.  **Storage:** These embeddings are stored in a vector database alongside metadata, such as source file names and page numbers.
3.  **Function:** This process allows the system to represent text in a vector space, enabling efficient similarity searches to retrieve the most relevant chunks for a given user query.",1,4,5,5,"The generated answer is factually accurate and fully grounded in the provided context. It defines embeddings as numerical representations (consistent with ""vector representations"") and details their usage in RAG (conversion, storage, retrieval). It matches the expected answer's semantic content perfectly, though it provides a more detailed step-by-step breakdown rather than a concise definition."
What is a vector database and why is it used in RAG?,"A vector database stores embeddings and enables fast similarity search. In RAG systems, vector databases like Qdrant or Pinecone store document embeddings and allow efficient retrieval of the most similar chunks to a query.","According to the **RAG Overview** document (Page 2), a **vector database** (such as Qdrant, Pinecone, or Weaviate) is essential for RAG systems for the following reasons:

1.  **Storage:** It stores the embeddings of document chunks.
2.  **Efficiency:** It enables efficient **similarity search**.
3.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question, the system converts the query into a vector and retrieves the most similar document chunks from the database.
4.  **Hybrid Search:** Modern vector databases support hybrid search, combining traditional keyword-based search (BM25) with semantic vector search. This dual approach ensures that both exact keyword matches and semantically similar content are retrieved, improving recall and precision.",1,5,5,5,"The generated answer accurately defines vector databases as storing embeddings and enabling similarity search, perfectly matching the core points of the expected answer. It is highly relevant to the question, addressing both the definition and the specific RAG use case. It is fully faithful to the retrieved context, as all details (including the mention of specific databases, hybrid search, and query conversion) are directly supported by the provided text."
What is LlamaIndex and what problem does it solve?,"LlamaIndex is a framework for building RAG applications. It provides tools for document ingestion, chunking, embedding, indexing, and querying, making it easier to connect LLMs with external data sources.","According to the **LlamaIndex Documentation** (Page 2), LlamaIndex is a framework for **connecting custom data with LLMs**.

It solves the problem of integrating specific, private, or real-time data into LLM applications. LLMs typically have a fixed context window and lack knowledge of private data or real-time updates. LlamaIndex bridges this gap by providing a modular collection of tools—including data connectors, indexes, retrievers, and query engines—to ingest, index, and retrieve this external data effectively.",1,5,5,1,"The generated answer is factually accurate and directly addresses the user's question about what LlamaIndex is and the problem it solves. However, it is not grounded in the provided retrieved context. The retrieved context lists use cases (Agents, Workflows, Query Engines, etc.) but does not contain the definition of LlamaIndex as a framework connecting custom data to LLMs or the explanation regarding context windows and private data. Therefore, the answer is hallucinated relative to the provided context."
